# Arduino LED Map Project (For Lone Star College (North Harris))

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to create an interactive LED map. It is part of a team learning journey in engineering and embedded systems @ LoneStar.

## Features
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Custom circuit design

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open 'sketch_oct30a.ino' in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload to the ESP32 board.

## Future Plans
- Add touch sensors
- integrate with LCD Touchscreen
